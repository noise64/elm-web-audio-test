WebAudio tests in elm
=====================

My webaudio - elm playground

How to run
----------

Need software:

  * [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
  * [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
  * recommended: [firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox); Use for opening the test page, as it seems to be the least glitchy currently.

```
npm install

grunt

open ./src/main/static-web/index.html
```
